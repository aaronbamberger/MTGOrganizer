# MTG Organizer

My wife has a lot of magic cards, and she wanted a tool to use to organize them,
collect stats about her collection, etc., so this is a start to a tool to do that.

I am well aware that there are lots of existing tools to do this.  For one reason
or another, none of the existing options has exactly the blend of features she's
interested in.  Perhaps more importantly, this seemed like a fun project, so I'm
doing it mostly because I want to.

I'm also using it as an excuse to fool around with various technologies I'm
interested in, so there's no guarantees that this will use the best/most efficient/
most popular/whatever technologies/libraries/patterns/etc.  I'm prioritizing
what interests me over basically anything else.

Lastly, I'm working on this in my spare time, as I feel inspired, so it's highly
likely development will be bursty, and may never finish.  I'm certainly not known
for being great at finishing personal projects.  While I always endeavor not to
commit broken code, it's highly likely that any random commit will contain all sorts
of weird debug stuff or random experiments I was doing at the time.

With all of that said, if this is interesting to anybody, feel free to grab it and
use it for whatever.  Big shoutout to the MTGJson project for providing the backing
store of card data that I'm using for this.
